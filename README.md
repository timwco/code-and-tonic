## Code & Tonic


### About This Theme

---

A [Barley Theme](http://www.getbarley.com) for my site [Code & Tonic](http://codeandtonic.com).

This theme is basically just a re-work of the WordPress theme [Required by 8bit](http://wordpress.org/themes/required) 

Feel free to use this however you want.

Also, feel free to subscribe to our [RSS Feed](http://codeandtonic.com/rss) or follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/codeandtonic).

### How To Use

---

I use the program [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/) to build our HTML, but you can feel free to just use the files in the `/Build` folder if you want. That is everything you need to power a Barley site.
